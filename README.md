## Features

- Interactive 3D model of a developer character with multiple animations
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Sections for showcasing projects, skills, and contact information
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Technologies Used

- React
- Three.js
- React Three Fiber
- @react-three/drei
- Tailwind CSS
- React Responsive

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by [Adrian Hajdin's 3D Portfolio](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/threejs-portfolio). Special thanks to Adrian for the creative inspiration and implementation ideas.

Key features adapted and expanded upon:

- 3D character model integration using Three.js and React Three Fiber
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Interactive animations for the 3D model
- Clean and modern UI using Tailwind CSS

While this project shares some conceptual similarities, it has been built from the ground up with custom implementations, additional features, and personal touches to create a unique portfolio experience.
